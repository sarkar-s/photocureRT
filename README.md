# photocureRT
Compute relaxation time from photocuring measurements. This software use simultaneous measurements of quantities during photopolymerization to comute the time-dependent relaxation time constant.

a) Degree of conversion
b) Temperature change due to the exothermic process
c) Displacement due to shrinkage during polymerization
d) Tensile stress at the contact surface due to the displacement
